## Hi there! :grin:

It's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Gabriela and I am 24 years old. Here are some information about me:  
  
- Graduated from State University of Londrina - [UEL](https://portal.uel.br/home/) - in Computer Science :computer:    
- Londrina - PR - Brazil :pushpin:   
- I've got experience (mainly) with Python, C and TypeScript/JavaScript. Also got some experience working with Azure Functions to develop some REST API's as well.
- Currently working at Tectrol and Move Smart, mainly working with backend and distributed systems.
- Willing to learn and help in whatever I can.

I have found myself really interested in networks and natural language processing. But I also enjoy plenty of other Computer Science fields and am ready to explore this big, vast, computer-filled world.
