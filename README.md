## Hi there! :grin:

It's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Gabriela and I am 23 years old. I'm currently at my fourth year at university, so here it goes:  
  
- Computer Science student at State University of Londrina - [UEL](https://portal.uel.br/home/) :computer:    
- Londrina - PR - Brazil :pushpin:   
- I've got experience (mainly) with Python, Java and C. Also got some experience working with Azure Functions to develop some REST API's as well. 
- Willing to learn and help in whatever I can.  

I have found myself really interested in networks and natural language processing those days. Mainly working with backend. But I also enjoy plenty of other Computer Science fields and am ready to explore this big, vast, computer-filled world.
